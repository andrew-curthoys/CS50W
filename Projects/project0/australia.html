              In the fall of 2019 I spent two weeks in Australia, which were two
              of the most enjoyable weeks of my life. The impetus for the trip
              was my cousin Brad's wedding. He is my cousin from my dad's side
              and grew up in Buffalo, NY, the hometown of my dad and where the
              majority of his side of the family lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2016, my cousin Brad moved to Houston, where he soon met his
              current wife, Angela. Angela is a delight and originally from
              Perth, Australia. They dated for a few years and then were engaged
              in the fall of 2018. In the summer of 2019 they moved to her
              hometown of Perth and began preparing for the wedding in October
              of 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              In October a group of about a dozen family and friends from the
              states made the long journey down under for the wedding and
              additional antipodean adventures. The 17 hour flight from Houston
              to Sydney was grueling, then the 5 hour flight from Sydney to
              Perth felt like torture. We finally made it, though, and were
              exhausted but ready to begin the trip of a lifetime.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Perth
            </h4>
            <p>
              Upon arriving in Perth, we met up with our friends and family at a
              restaurant on the Swan River for a get-together the night before
              the wedding. We cut it close getting to Australia only one day
              before the wedding, but we were able to score flights from Houston
              to Sydney for only $525 on those dates!
            </p>
            <p>
              We made a point to try to power through the exhaustion that
              afternoon so we could go to bed at a reasonable hour and try to
              reset our body clocks. I made it to bed about 9 PM and woke up
              fresh as a daisy the next morning around 10. It was a long and
              well-deserved slumber.
            </p>
            <p>
              That morning my brother and I took a stroll around Kings Park, a
              world-class park that I read about in Bill Bryson's outstanding
              book on his travels in Australia called <i>"In A Sunburnded
              Country."</i> After jaunting around Perth for a few hours, it was
              time to get ready for the wedding. I was a groomsman so we all got
              suited and booted together, and had a few pints to take the edge
              off
            </p>
            <p>
              The wedding went off without a hitch, Angela looked absolutely
              stunning and the service was beautiful. The only conceivable
              disadvantage was the Australia-England World Cup quarterfinal
              rugby match was at the same time as the wedding so some of the
              Aussie blokes were unhappy about that.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the wedding we took some photos at Kings Park with the
              wedding party, then headed to the Perth Zoo for the reception.
              It was at the reception that we discovered that Angela's family
              was just as big and boisterous as our own. The two families took
              to each other like a duck to water. To say we had fun was an
              understatement. A highlight was the exquisite toast that my father
              gave, with just the right amount of poignancy, wit, and humour. He
              was lovingly referred to my the Australian denizens as the
              "Funcle." That day is a memory that I will cherish forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next day, we all gathered at Angela's parent's house and had a
              good old fashioned Australian barbie. Angela's brother who owns a
              brewery (we'll get to that in a minute) brought a couple kegs of
              craft beer and the food was tremendous. We left right as the sun
              was going down and the Aussies were getting turned up. It was
              probably the best for my well-being the next morning that we left
              but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a mild curiosity to see
              where the night was headed with a group of wild Aussies.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Exmouth
            </h4>
            <p>
              The day after the wedding, the majority of us made our way to
              Exmouth, a long way up the Western coast of Australia on the
              Ningaloo Reef. This was the town where Angela's brother, Justin,
              owned the aforementioned brewery, Whalebone Brewing. We drank many
              a pint at the brewery over the next few days and ate our fair
              share of delicious wood fired pizzas. The highlight of the brewery
              was a Woodstock themed party, where everyone dressed like hippies
              and they had a great live band.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the delicious beer, we had quite a few outdoor
              adventures during our time in Exmouth. One day we took a hike
              through a beautiful river gorge, with breathtaking views and some
              very nice hiking trails. After the hike we all refreshed ourselves
              with a nice snorkel at Turquoise Bay, a beautiful bay on the
              Indian ocean with tremendous snorkeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next day, my parents, my brother, and I went SCUBA diving at
              the Navy Pier, a pier built by the US during WWII and subsequently
              purchased by the Australian Navy after the war. The dive masters
              claimed it was one of the top 10 dive sites in the world, which if
              that's the case then I've been to 1-9 because the dive was nice
              but I wouldn't consider it among the best in the world. In any
              case we had a great time and I always enjoy a chance to go diving.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last day, my mom, brother, and I took microlight flights
              around the peninsula, which are like paragliders with propellers.
              The feeling when we first took off was indescribable, it was such
              a thrill and adrenaline rush. We flew around the Exmouth bay for
              a while looking for humpback whales to no avail, then flew over
              the Exmouth peninsula over to the Indian Ocean side, over the area
              we snorkeled at Turquoise Bay. The views from up there were
              spectacular and we saw myriad wildlife, including dolphins, sea
              turtles, many different types of rays, and massive schools of
              fish. It was one of the most fun and exhilarating experiences of
              my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              With our time in Exmouth coming to a close, we wished Justin and
              his family adieu and made it to our final stop on the trip - 
              Sydney.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Sydney
            </h4>
            <p>
              We arrived to Sydney in the early evening and took a short Uber
              ride downtown to our hotel. The accommodations were fabulous, we
              had a full kitchen, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a full sized
              balcony that looked out over downtown Sydney. The downtown skyline
              is mesmerizing, especially from a balcony at nighttime. We had
              just enough energy to grab a bite at a restaurant a few blocks
              from the hotel, which brings me to a digression on the food and
              drink in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can't think of a bad meal we had the entire
              trip and the coffee was absolutely fantastic. When we first got to
              Australia, my brother and I got flat whites at a coffee shop in
              the airport and it was far superior to the majority of the coffee
              we get in the States. That trend would continue throughout the
              trip, every cup of coffee I had was excellent. The coffee alone is
              enough to not want to leave the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              On our first full day in Sydney, our parents slept in while my
              brother and I explored the city. We walked all over downtown,
              around the harbor, to Circular Quay, and got great views of the
              two most iconic landmarks of Sydney - the Opera House and the
              Sydney Harbor Bridge. When we made it back to the hotel, our
              parents were up & ready to explore so we walked around some more
              parts of downtown and ventured through some parks. It was a pretty
              relaxing day but we got to see the character of the city, which I
              fell in love with. The best description I can give of the city is
              that it's like New York, except it's clean and the people are
              nice. That night we had another wonderful meal and turned in early
              to get ready for my most anticipated activity of the trip - the
              Sydney Harbor Bridge climb
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a nerd when it comes to bridges so the Sydney Harbor Bridge
              was one of the things I was most excited to see when we got to
              Sydney. The best part is they have a tour that allows you to hike
              to the top of the massive arches that support the bridge. From the
              top you are afforded stunning views of the entire harbor, and one
              of the most unique views of the Opera House exactly two times
              higher than the roof of the Opera House (the Opera House was
              intentionally built to 220 ft tall in a nod to the 440 ft height
              of the harbor bridge).
            </p>
            <p>
              After the bridge climb we met our parents at Circular Quay and
              took a ferry to Manly Beach, a laid back beach town on the outer
              harbor on the South Pacific. We wandered around town and enjoyed
              the views, some snacks, and a few pints. The laid back atmosphere
              was a welcome contrast to the hustle and bustle of Sydney.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we returned to Sydney, my dad and I walked around town to a
              few bars that I had read about or were suggested by friends or
              family. One in particular stands out, the Baxter Inn. This is a
              speakeasy in the strictest sense. While it was on Google Maps, we
              had to walk down an alley to a courtyard, where we had to ask for
              directions and were pointed to an unmarked stairwell that led down
              into one of the most incredible bars I have ever been to in my
              life. The decor was something you would find during Prohibition,
              but it wasn't gaudy as these things often are. The bar was
              gorgeous and stocked with the most diverse assortment of liqors I
              have ever seen. The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable and
              offered suggestions of whiskeys based on our preferences. I had
              two glasses of rye that were amazing from bottles I haven't seen
              before or since. Needless to say we had a blast.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next day we took an Uber to Bondi Beach, a world famous beach
              and for good reason. The seasons were just turning to Spring & the
              weather was gorgeous, although the water was still quite chilly
              (although I imagine the South Pacific is always quite frigid).
              Luckily for us the beach wasn't too crowded as I imagine it gets
              during the summertime. We had a good time lounging on the beach
              and splashing around in the chilly water for a while, after which
              my brother and I made walked part of the way down the Bondi to
              Cougee Beach trail. This is a trail cut along the cliffs from
              Bondi Beach about 3 miles south to Cougee Beach. We only made it
              about halfway before heading back to downtown, but along the way
              were spectacular views and a series of art installations that had
              been erected as part of a public art project that Sydney had
              recently embarked on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our final day was last but not least. That day we toured the
              Sydney Opera House, the eye catching icon of the city. I was
              expecting to enjoy the Opera House and the tour, but I was
              completely blown away by the Opera House, its history, and our
              tour guide. The structure itself is so much more impressive in
              person than in photos. Up close you get a sense of the scale of
              the buildings and the architecture is irresistible. The curvature
              and lines of the buildings are mesmerizing and the interior is
              just as stunning, if not more so, than the exterior. The attention
              to detail is remarkable, as every aspect of the buildings were
              build with acoustics in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              The intangible aspect that made it so much more enjoyable was our
              tour guide, Peter. He had the most soothing Australian voice and
              his grasp of the history and details of the building were
              remarkable. It makes perfect sense as we came to find out at the
              very end of the tour that he studied under the architect who was
              in charge of completing the structure, and had in fact, designed
              some aspects of it himself! It was, to say the least, worth the
              price of admission.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the Opera House we walked through the botanical gardens and
              enjoyed one last night in Sydney, which just so happened to be
              Halloween. When we first touched down in Sydney at the start of
              the trip, we had all looked at each other and said we're never
              coming here again after that flight. Well when we were back in the
              same airport two weeks later, getting ready to board a flight back
              to the States to our chagrin, we all looked to each other again
              and said we couldn't wait to come back. It was a marvelous trip in
              a magnificent country.
