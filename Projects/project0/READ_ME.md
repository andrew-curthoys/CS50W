This website is pretty straightforward, although it was quite fun to make.

The overall theme of the site is the story of the 6 continents I have been to.
For all intents and purposes I have really only gotten to explore 3 continents-
North America, South America, and Australia. The other 3 - Europe, Asia, and
Africa all happened on a single work trip, with Europe and Asia both happening
in Istanbul (it technically straddles Europe and Asia) and our time in Egypt
was spent between the hotel and the office because it was during the Arab Spring
and security was high.

The index page has a table of all the continents I have been to and the dates,
along with links to individual pages of each continent.

Each continent page has a description of my time on that continent with photos
from each trip. At the bottom of each page is a footer with links to every other
page.
