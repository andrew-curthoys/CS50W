              I have had the pleasure to take two trips to South America, one to
              Chile and another to Brazil. The first trip was a gift from my
              uncle, who gave each of my brothers a trip as a gift for our high
              school graduation. This was the same uncle who, along with my dad,
              taught me how to ski. Naturally our trip was to Chile to go skiing
              in July.
            </p>
            <p>
              We flew into Santiago, which was an amazing and beautiful city.
              From there we rented a car and made the drive up to Portillo, in
              the heart of the Andes Mountains right on the border of Argentina.
              We spent 4-5 days skiing, some of which we had to wait out because
              the snow was so heavy and the weather was so windy. Luckily the
              hotel had a heated pool, a hot tub, and plenty of dining and
              recreation activities to pass the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we were able to ski, the conditions were incredible. The
              fresh snow was amazing and the mountain was not crowded at all. My
              uncle, cousin, and I bombed up and down the mountain all day. It
              was some amazing skiing. After skiing, we drove across the country
              to the coast and the towns of Valparaiso and Vina del Mar. We
              stayed at a hotel that was built on top of some jagged rocks
              jutting out into the Pacific Ocean and toured around the town most
              days and took a tour of the famous poet Pablo Neruda. We even took
              a quick dip in the ocean, which was probably the coldest water I
              have ever felt in my entire life. Unfortunately I wasn't able to
              find any photos from that trip, although I'm sure we have some
              somewhere.

              My second trip to South America was to Brazil for my friend's
              wedding. This was a friend I grew up with in Tulsa, who met a
              Brazilian girl while attending the US Military Academy at West
              Point. She is from a city called Belo Horizonte, the fourth
              largest city in Brazil. When we arrived we were immediately
              whisked to a soccer game by the bride's brother and his friends,
              where we got the full Brazilian soccer experience. I still check
              in on their local team, Cruzeiro, from time to time and have a
              team scarf hanging in my house.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next few days we spent touring around Belo Horizonte, seeing
              the sights and enjoying the delicious food and culture that Brazil
              has to offer. The wedding turned out wonderfully, with drinks
              and dancing lasting well into the night. Brazilians certainly know
              how to dance!
            </p>
            <p>
              After Belo, a group of friends from Tulsa made the trip to Rio for
              a few days. Affectionately called <i>Cidade Maravilhosa</i> (the
              Marvelous City), Rio is a spectacular place. I had made a list of
              sights to see and things to do in the city while we were there,
              but we didn't get to all of them due to the lure of the beach,
              with its delicious pork sandwiches and caipirinhas (the national
              drink of Brazil).
            </p>
            <p>
              We did, however, make it to the Cristo Redentor (Christ the
              Redeemer), the famous statue of Jesus on a mountaintop in the
              center of the city. The rest of the trip we spent on the beach and
              enjoying the outstanding food and drink that Rio had to offer. We
              even had a drink at the bar where the song <i>The Girl From
              Ipanema</i> was written. It was a spectacular trip and I would
              love to go back to take a tram to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain
              and see a soccer game at the Maracana Stadium, among other things.
