              The only time I have stepped foot on Asian soil was my trip to
              Turkey en route to Egypt for work. We had meetings in Cairo so a
              few co-workers and I decided to spend some time in Istanbul and
              Ismir before getting to Cairo. Our trip to Istanbul was amazing,
              and you can read more about that in the Europe section. The only
              Asian part of Istanbul we went to was a small fort at the northern
              mouth of the Bosphorous Strait, right on the edge of the Black
              Sea. It was a pretty neat tour, but a short one. The best part of
              that was probably the ferry ride from Istanbul up to the fort,
              which provided great views of the strait and the immense
              suspension bridges that spanned it
             </p>
             <p>
               The main part of our Asian experience was in Ismir and the
               nearby ruins of Ephesus. Ismir is a great seaside town on the
               Aegean Sea, with all the trappings of a Mediterranean city. We
               spent some time in Ismir and had some great meals and met some
               very nice people.
             </p>
             <p>
               While we were in Ismir we took a trip to the ancient ruins of
               Ephesus. This was a great experience where we were able to see
               the city rebuilt as it was centuries ago. There were numerous
               large structures that had been beautifully restored and a couple
               amazing amphitheaters that were quite stunning. It was well worth
               the trip.
